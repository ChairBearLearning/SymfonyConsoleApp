This was my first attempt at a Symfony Console Application. 

I have had some experience in Symfony applications previously, including a basic CRUD application (a simple ‘bookstore’) and a random number generator, however my main experience with PHP frameworks is with Laravel. 

I thought I’d attempt my first every Symfony Console Application as my technical test for you, to demonstrate that I am willing to learn new things and are a quick learner.

I rather found this new experience fun, as I ran into a few issues I’d never come across before and it was great to figure out how to fix them to give a working application. 

My time break down is as below:
- 10 Min set up time
- 1 Hour learning about Symfony Console Applications
- 50 Min TDD (Test Driven Development)
- 30 Min adding documentation  
- 5 Min amend code for new Symfony version (error fix)
